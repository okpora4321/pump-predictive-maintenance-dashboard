# 🚰 Pump Predictive Maintenance Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **pump health monitoring and predictive maintenance system** using just **Microsoft Excel**.  
The goal is to help companies track the degradation of pumps, predict failures, and schedule maintenance ahead of time — ultimately reducing downtime and extending pump lifetime.

## ❗ Problem Statement
Industrial pumps are critical assets in many operations. But most organizations still rely on **manual inspections** and **reactive maintenance**, which:  
- 🛑 Leads to unexpected breakdowns  
- 💸 Causes production downtime and losses  
- ⚡ Shortens the useful lifetime of pumps  

---

## ✅ Solution Approach
I developed a **predictive maintenance dashboard** that uses simple log data to track pump health and performance.  
The system allows employees to:  

- ✅ Monitor pump degradation trends over time  
- ✅ Classify pump condition (Good, Needs Check, Critical)  
- ✅ Measure efficiency and lifetime used  
- ✅ Predict potential failures ahead of time  
- ✅ Support **data-driven maintenance scheduling**

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Logged pump usage (ID, Date, Status, Usage Hours, etc.).  
- Cleaned and structured dataset in Excel.  

### 2. Calculated Metrics
- **Efficiency %** → Normalized performance of each pump per use.  
- **Degradation Rate** → Decline in efficiency over time.  
- **Lifetime Used %** → Remaining useful life of each pump.  

### 3. Dashboard Development
- Used **Pivot Tables** for aggregation.  
- Created **Slicers** for interactive filtering (Pump ID & Date).  
- Built charts to visualize:  
  - 📉 Pump degradation trends  
  - 🟢 Pump condition categories  
  - ⏳ Lifetime used vs. remaining

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- **Degradation Trend** → Track pump health changes per usage  
- **Lifetime Tracker** → Monitor % of life used vs. remaining  
- **Condition Summary** → Pumps automatically classified as:  
  - 🟢 Good  
  - 🟡 Needs Check  
  - 🔴 Critical  
- **Interactive Slicers** → Quick filtering by Pump ID or Date Range

## 🚀 Impact & Use Cases
- 📉 Reduces unplanned downtime  
- 🛠️ Optimizes maintenance scheduling  
- ⏳ Extends pump lifetime  
- 📊 Enables data-driven decision making for asset management
